### Graph Embeddings: 


- [A survey on knowledge graphs: Representation, acquisition and applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00388): Comprehensive review on state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models.  
- [An overview of embedding models of entities and relationships for knowledge base completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08098): Summary of different types of scoring functions

### Reasoning: 
- [A survey on empathetic dialogue systems](https://ww.sentic.net/empathetic-dialogue-systems.pdf): Literature review of empathetic dialogue systems, whose goal is to enhance the perception and expression of emotional states, personal preference, and knowledge. 

### Deep Learning: 
- [ReadNet: Towards Accurate ReID with Limited and Noisy Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05740)
- [Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08791): The key distinguishing property of a bayesian approach is marginalization instead of optimization. Rather than use a single setting of parameters w, use all settings weighted by their posterior probabilities in a bayesian model average 
- [LambdaNetworks: Modeling long-range Interactions without Attention](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xTJEN-ggl1b): Transforming image context into linar layers (Lambdas). LambdaResNets reach state-of-the-art accuracies on ImageNet while being âˆ¼4.5x faster than the popular EfficientNets on modern machine learning accelerators. 

### Reinforcement Learning: 

- [Ecological Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12478.pdf): Aim to study how the non-episodic RL problem is affected by particular properties of the training environments.

### NLP:
- [Reformer: The efficient Tranformer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkgNKkHtvB): Introduce two techniques to imporve efficiency, such as, locality-sensitive hashing and reversible residual layers.
